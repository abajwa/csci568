This directory contains the write-up and work for Project 9 - KDD Cup Challenge

The KDD Cup is a data mining challenge hosted by Yahoo! Labs. In this project we were given the task of creating a working solution for Track 1 of the KDD Cup 2011 Challenge. The dataset for this challenge consists of Yahoo! Music data. It is made up of tracks, albums, artists, and genres which all tie together. The different items (albums, users, tracks, etc.) are given meaningless anonymous numbers so that no identifying information is released.
