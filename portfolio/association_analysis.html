  <h2>Association Analysis</h2>

  <p class="introduction">
    Association analysis is a methodology that is useful for discovering interesting relationships that are hidden in large data sets. This method of model builing involves two major tasks. The first task is frequent itemset generation and the second is rule generation. These tasks can be simplified by using the A Priori algorithm and principle.
  </p>
  <h3>Model Building Process</h3>
  <p class="algorithm">
    The typical association analysis model building process involves two major subtasks: frequent itemset generation and rule generation. Frequent itemset generation generates only itemsets that satisfy the minimum support threshold. The objective of rule generation is to extract all of the high confidence rules (see Figure 1 for confidence equation) from the frequent itemsets. Since it is too expensive to compute all the possible itsemsets, frequent itemset generation is used to only generate frequent itemsets using a principle called A Priori. The A Priori principle states that if an itemset is frequent then all of its subsets must also be frequent and inversely, if an itemset is infrequent then all of its supersets must also be infrequent. Using the A Priori algorithm for frequent itemset generation is a form of support-based pruning. After choosing a support (see Figure 1 for support equation) threshold the support of every 1-itemset is calculated. The itemsets that do not meet the threshold are thrown out due to the A Priori principle since all supersets of infrequent itemsets are also infrequent. At this point the algorithm is left with all the frequent 1-itemsets. These frequent itemsets are then combined to form 2-itemsets which are subject to the same elimination process. This process continues to generate frequent itemsets until no more itemsets can be generated.

    <br />
    After the frequent itemsets have been generated, the rule generation begins. Each of the frequent k-itemsets can potentially produce 2^k-2 association rules. Initially, all high confidence rules that have only one item in the consequent are extracted and are used to generate new candidate rules. An association rule can be extracted from the frequent itemset by partitioning the itemset I into two non-empty subsets I and S-I such that I -> S-I satisfy the confidence threshold but all rules must have already met the support threshold because they were generated from frequent itemsets. New rules are generated in the A Priori approach by merging the consequents of the previously generated rules. If a node in the lattice generated by this approach has low confidence then the entire sub graph can be pruned immediately. These rules are generated for all of the frequent itemsets.

  <h3>Common Use Case, Benefits, and Drawbacks</h3>
  <p class="algorithm">
    Association analysis is commonly used in in the application of transaction data in stores. It can be used to associate items with other items; giving rules about the items that people tend to buy together. For example if someone buys Beer, they are likely to buy diapers. The drawbacks of using the A Priori approach for association analysis are that the computational complexity can be high, especially if the support threshold is low since more itemsets will be declared frequent. As the number of items in the itemset increases, more space will be needed to store the support counts. Also, the more transaction data there is, the longer A Priori will take since it makes multiple passes over the data. The major benefit of A Priori frequent itemset generation and rule generation is the fact that the algorithm cuts down on a lot of complexity by using the A Priori principle to prune the data.
